# Next.js example

## How to use

This dashboard is based on the example found in this [repository](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui):

Clone the repo, install it and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/twoisprime/nextjs-mui-dashboard.git
cd nextjs-mui-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## The link component

Next.js has [a custom Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).
The example folder provides adapters for usage with MUI.
More information [in the documentation](https://mui.com/guides/routing/#next-js).

## What's next?

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/getting-started/templates/) section.
